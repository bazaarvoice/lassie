Thank you for contributing to project Lassie.
=============================================


If you would like to add to the code base then there are a few things we would like you to follow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guidelines
----------


* Thorough yet meaningful testing of all additions to the code base.
** It's easy to make a test for every new feature and parameters but please try to avoid tests that overlap with current code.
* Follow naming conventions and best practices.
** All contributing code should match in style and implementation
* Keep additional libraries to a minimum, and optimize imports.
** We would like to keep the code focused on the tricks lassie can do, so the addition of large libraries would distracting from the overall purpose.
